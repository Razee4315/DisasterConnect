# DisasterConnect Development Prompt

## Project Context
DisasterConnect is a PyQt5-based disaster management system that helps coordinate emergency responses and resource management during disasters. The application uses OpenStreetMap for visualization and MongoDB for data storage.

## Current Implementation
We have successfully implemented:
- Authentication system with MongoDB backend
- Basic dashboard interface using PyQt5
- Incident and resource management systems
- Interactive map with location selection
- Fixed map interaction issues (zooming, markers, events)

## Development Focus
We are now focusing on enhancing the application's core functionality to make it more effective for disaster response coordination.

## Primary Task: Map Enhancement
### Objective
Implement advanced mapping features to improve disaster response visualization and coordination.

### Specific Features to Implement
1. Heatmap Visualization
   - Show incident density across regions
   - Use color gradients to indicate severity
   - Implement dynamic updating

2. Cluster Visualization
   - Group nearby incidents
   - Show cluster sizes
   - Implement zoom-based clustering

3. Location Search
   - Add search bar in map interface
   - Implement geocoding
   - Add auto-complete suggestions

4. Route Planning
   - Calculate optimal routes between resources and incidents
   - Consider traffic and road conditions
   - Show estimated arrival times

## Secondary Task: UI Enhancement
### Objective
Create a more intuitive and informative dashboard for better decision-making.

### Features to Implement
1. Customizable Dashboard
   - Draggable widgets
   - User-specific layouts
   - Real-time data updates

2. Advanced Incident Management
   - Priority-based sorting
   - Status filtering
   - Template-based creation

## Technical Requirements
- Use Leaflet.js for map features
- Implement PyQt5 for UI components
- Ensure MongoDB integration
- Maintain responsive performance

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Focus on one feature at a time
2. Maintain existing code structure
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Include user feedback mechanisms
5. Write clear documentation

## Next Steps
1. Start with heatmap implementation:
   - Research Leaflet.js heatmap plugins
   - Design data structure for incident density
   - Create PyQt5-JavaScript bridge for data transfer

2. Then move to clustering:
   - Implement marker clustering
   - Design cluster appearance
   - Add cluster interaction handlers

## Additional Notes
- Prioritize performance optimization
- Consider scalability
- Focus on user experience
- Maintain code quality

## Resources
- Leaflet.js documentation
- PyQt5 documentation
- MongoDB Python driver documentation
- OpenStreetMap API documentation

This prompt will guide the next development phase of DisasterConnect, focusing on enhancing its mapping capabilities and user interface to create a more effective disaster management tool.
